# COVID-19-TRENDS

## Project overview

1. The continent with the least outbreak of COVID-19
2. The continent with highest outbreak of COVID-19
3. Continent with higher vaccination
4. Continent with more death rates
5. Continent with more positive rate/ recovery rate.

## KEY INSIGHTS 
1. interactive visualization
2. User friendly interface
3. Data driven insights.

## TOOLS AND DATA SOURCE 
- ### TOOLS: Pyton, Jupyter Notebook
- ### DATA SOURCES: Our world in Data COVID-19 Dataset(Github). This datasets include columns such as continents, total cases, total deaths, people vaccinated, life expectancy etc

## DATA PREPARATION PROCESS
The data was imported into python using (import pandas as pd). Data was stored in a csv.file

## DATA ANALYSIS 
## OVERVIEW
- Heatmap for missing data
- Bar Chart for visualizing the missing columns to understand if the missing datas correlates
- Identifying the trends and relationship between 'total_cases', 'total_deaths and people fully vaccinated using line charts
- Scatter plot to understand the number of cases and poitive rate
- Barchart to visualize the continent showing 'total_deaths', 'total_cases', 'people_fully_vaccinated' of each continents
- Heatmap showing the distribution of COVID-19 geographically
- Pie Chart showing the percentage of each each continents with Cases, Deaths, Vaccination and Recovery rate.

## CONCLUSION
1. Oceania had the least outbreak and deaths rate
2. Asia had more outbreak
3. Europe had more death rates
4. Asia had higher percentage of vaccinaton
5. Europe had the highest positive/recovery rate even thought it recorded more deaths unlike others.
